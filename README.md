# DrSlidy

Browser-based presentation slides in Markdown. A
quick-and-slightly-less-dirty version of
[Quickslides](https://github.com/airportyh/QuickSlides).

## To use:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Edit `presentation.md`.
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser
4. Print `simple.html` for presentation notes.

If your browser has trouble reading the static site off the disk (this
can happen), there's also a shell script that will (hopefully) serve
the site on port 8000:

    ./server/server.sh 


## Sample Presentation

The default presentation is also the manual.  You can view it as:

* [Presentation slides](http://suetanvil.github.io/DrSlidy)
* [Speaker Notes](http://suetanvil.github.io/simple.html) (doubles as
  a manual)
* [Githubified presentation source](https://github.com/suetanvil/DrSlidy/blob/gh-pages/presentation.md).
